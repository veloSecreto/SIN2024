implemented deferred shading
noticed some artifacts on pixels, caused by the specular textures incorrect value (albedo.a)
will fix this later by adding rma attachment in the Geometry buffer or while implementing PBR
also the light and skybox isn't rendering in the correct way, perhaps the depth data wasn't sent correctly
for now just sleep, worked a lot today

forgot to add updates :)
the artifacts were gone, tried to implement the bindless texture, but alas
my hardware doesn't support it :) so just cancelled the idea
today I enabled gamma correction, add fps mechanism to trace performance and implemented pbr,
and now running on the texture management issue
found a way, and working on that, it needs to manually set material properties for each model,
this is quit modern and efficient
however, lessss go  to sleep
neva quit, neva die

improved material system a lot, adding setParameter actions
also figured out that the ao and gamma is applied incorrectly
the scene looks sick now, will try to implement shadows tomorrow

shadows were not implemented, but tried to compile compute shaders since the last 2 days
got compute shaders not working at the 60% completion, but actually it was a really small problem
coords and texCoords aren't the same, the coords are actually  the global invocation ID of ann invocation
and the texcoords are texture coordinates simply, that was the problem
however, noticed that in compute texture coordinates aren't the same, it isn't the same as the model defined coordinates
and also performance drops with compute shaders
so lighting in compute shader is currently depcrated
I don't know what is next, but perhaps shadows for sure
I think I will start implementing the editor from tomorrow
it is midnight and for now just sleep
never gonna stop

hell yeah, got the gizmos working, it was a long journey
im3d is a bit weird, but extreme lightweight and powerful
got scaling, translating and rotating the house with the gizmo somehow
need to refine a bit
but got a new bug, a yellow overlay like shit appears to the screen
however, worked a lot today, now just have dinner and sleep

didn't make any recap last time
the yellow shit has gone, just because I wasn't using the projection and view matrix
the rotation also fixed, by converting the radians to degrees
currently working on the selection mechanism
got aabbs last time, also obb
debug lines has been implemented also
a lot of improvements since last time
however, now just go to play
