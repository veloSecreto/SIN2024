implemented deferred shading
noticed some artifacts on pixels, caused by the specular textures incorrect value (albedo.a)
will fix this later by adding rma attachment in the Geometry buffer or while implementing PBR
also the light and skybox isn't rendering in the correct way, perhaps the depth data wasn't sent correctly
for now just sleep, worked a lot today
