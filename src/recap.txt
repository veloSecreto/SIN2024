implemented deferred shading
noticed some artifacts on pixels, caused by the specular textures incorrect value (albedo.a)
will fix this later by adding rma attachment in the Geometry buffer or while implementing PBR
also the light and skybox isn't rendering in the correct way, perhaps the depth data wasn't sent correctly
for now just sleep, worked a lot today

forgot to add updates :)
the artifacts were gone, tried to implement the bindless texture, but alas
my hardware doesn't support it :) so just cancelled the idea
today I enabled gamma correction, add fps mechanism to trace performance and implemented pbr,
and now running on the texture management issue
found a way, and working on that, it needs to manually set material properties for each model,
this is quit modern and efficient
however, lessss go  to sleep
neva quit, neva die

improved material system a lot, adding setParameter actions
also figured out that the ao and gamma is applied incorrectly
the scene looks sick now, will try to implement shadows tomorrow
